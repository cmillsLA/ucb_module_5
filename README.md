# Module 5 - Practical Application 1

## Overview
Analyze customer data to find the target audience with the highest conversion rate to deliver geolocated coupons.  Data was analyzed for both `Bar` coupons as well as `Coffee` coupons.

### Bar Coupons
First, an analysis was done to check the frequency the customer visited a bar every month.  The results indicate customers that visit 3 or more times per month had a 77% coupon acceptance rate while other customers had a 37% average acceptance rate.

From that dataset looking at age it appears customers over 25 years old had an acceptance rate of 70% while under 25 had an acceptance rate of only 41%.  Going further, customers under 30 had an acceptance rate of 72% which is about the same as people with adult passangers in their car.

In conclusion, the most noteable metric for coupon acceptance were people that visited bars more than 3 times per month.

### Coffee Coupons
When analyzing coupon acceptance for `Coffee`, I took a similar approach.  First, with visualizations to note any major differences.  This showed a higher acceptance ratio in the morning hours.  From there I wanted to see where people were going, assuming `work` would be the most popular destination.  It turns out people with a `No urgent place` destination in mind had the highest coupon acceptance rate.

Analyzing further, it appears income didn't play as big of a role as it did for bar coupons.  However, people that were with passangers had a 58% acceptance rate.
